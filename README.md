MY RANDOM COUNTRY WAS  FRANCE

My project topic is an CALCULATOR WEBSITE....... This is simple calculator which has some basic calculation operations(add,decrease,multiply,division,percentage).
In this project  i want to give respect to French Mathematicians Ren√© Descartes who is founder of analytical geometry, one of the key figures of the scientific revolution.

I think is very important thing for students ,scientists.
